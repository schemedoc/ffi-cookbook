# Scheme FFI Cookbook

This is a collection of ready-to-run examples of using the foreign
function interface (FFI) in various Scheme implementations.

The repository is broken up into directories by topic, with files for
each implementation. The naming convention for example files is
`<example>-<implementation>.scm` with an accompanying
`<example>-<implementation>.sh` which compiles (if applicable) and
runs the example.
