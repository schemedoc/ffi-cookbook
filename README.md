# Scheme FFI Cookbook

This is collection of ready-to-run examples of using the foreign function interface (FFI)
in various Scheme dialects.

The repository is broken up into directories by topic, with files for each dialect.
The naming convention for example files is `<example>-<dialect>.scm` with an accompanying
`<example>-<dialect>.sh` which compiles (if applicable) and runs the example.
